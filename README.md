# Washington Counties Sustainable Living Campaign

## Description
This repository contains a map created from ArcGIS Pro. 

## Project 1: Sustainable Living Campaign 
- **Objective**: Identify suitable regions in Washington State for implementing an "alternative living" campaign. This initiative aims to encourage community and home gardening, recycling, and alternative transportation methods. The approach involves analyzing demographic and spatial characteristics at the county level to establish a prioritization baseline based on age and income.
- **Tools Used**: ArcGIS Pro
- **Key Insights**: Based on demographic and economic data, Washington State comprises 39 counties. King County, with a median age of 37, boasts the highest median income at $116,340, while Whitman County reports the lowest median household income at $49,345. Considering both age distribution and income levels, counties like Whatcom, Chelan, Douglas, and Spokane appear to be prime candidates for prioritization due to their relatively younger populations and moderate income levels. However, it's important to note that population density can skew perceptions of priority; for instance, while King County has over 2 million residents, smaller counties like Whatcom (with a population of 228,000) may proportionally exhibit higher concentrations of young and middle-income individuals. Utilizing percentage breakdowns within each county could provide a more accurate basis for prioritization, mitigating potential biases inherent in the data analysis process.
